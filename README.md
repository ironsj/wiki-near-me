# Wiki Near Me
This is an application I am creating that allows the user to see locations with Wikipedia articles near them. I am making this application for two reasons:
1. To create my first ever React Native application
2. I love Wikipedia

### Todo:
* Allow user to go to their current location on the map
* Find out how to get Wikipedia articles to show up as markers on map
* Allow user to move to new part of map and refresh for new Wikipedia articles
* Cluster markers together for high density areas/ when you zoom out
