# Wiki Near Me
This is an application I am creating that allows the user to see locations with Wikipedia articles near them. I am making this application for two reasons:
1. To create my first ever React Native application
2. I love Wikipedia

### Todo:
* Allow user to go to their current location on the map
* Allow user to click link on the marker to go to the Wikipedia page.
* Display more information/images, if possible
* Find distance displayed on the map to avoid making requests for articles that will not be within the range
* Cluster markers together for high density areas/ when you zoom out
